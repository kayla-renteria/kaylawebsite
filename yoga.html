        <p style="margin-top: 50px; text-align: left">
            Yoga is a practice that involves breath work, meditation, and physical poses. Research shows that yoga
            has
            many mental health benefits, including learning to better regulate emotional responses, learning to
            cultivate mindfulness through breath work and movement, and increasing awareness and connection to our
            bodies. Yoga has been shown to lower our autonomic stress response, relax muscle tension, reduce blood
            pressure, and decrease emotional distress.

        <h2>What Is Trauma-Informed Yoga?</h2>

        <p style="text-align: left">Trauma-informed yoga means that the yoga teacher teaches classes from a
            trauma-informed perspective. This
            means that the yoga teacher has knowledge and holds awareness of how trauma affects individuals in
            different
            ways, and is sensitive to this in the way that they teach every class. In a trauma-informed yoga class,
            you
            can expect to experience the following:
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Invitational language instead of strict instruction and commands</li>
                <li>No physical hands-on adjustments or assists unless given expressed consent</li>
                <li>The focus to be on connection to own body and not on ‘achieving the right pose’ or ‘achieving
                    certain level of flexibility/strength’ etc.
                </li>
                <li>Alternating high intensity vs. low intensity movements to increase heart rate variability</li>
                <li>Many options, allowing each participant to practice making empowered choices,
                    opting in or out of any portion of the class at any time.</li>
                <li>Greater focus on breath work that helps to regulate autonomic nervous system</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
