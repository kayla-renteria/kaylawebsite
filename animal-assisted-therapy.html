            <h2>Animal Assisted Therapy</h2>
            <p>
                Animal-assisted therapy is a therapeutic intervention that incorporates animals, such as dogs, into the
                treatment plan. It is used to enhance and complement the benefits of traditional therapy. Research
                shows that working with animals in an outpatient mental health setting provides a calming, comforting
                resource during therapeutic processing. In fact, the simple act of petting animals releases an automatic
                relaxation response, releasing serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin- all hormones that can play a part in
                elevating moods and promoting healthy processing of emotion.

                I am a Certified Animal Assisted Therapist (CAAT), and have received extensive training through the
                Animal Assisted Therapy Programs of Coloradoâ€™s certification program. I have experience providing
                therapeutic interventions in a variety of settings that harness the power of the human-animal
                connection in healing. I really believe in the comfort provided through this special relationship we
                have
                with animals.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my practice, I offer animal assisted interventions to my clients as deemed appropriate. My dog,
                Fender, who you can learn more about below, accompanies me to the office on scheduled days. Clients
                are made aware of her presence at their appointment beforehand, and of course, clients are welcome
                to decline her presence at their appointment and any interaction with her if they choose.
                Many clients find that the presence of a dog makes therapy more approachable, relaxed, and
                comforting.
