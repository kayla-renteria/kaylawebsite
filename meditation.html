            Meditation is an ancient practice that has many mental health benefits, including stress reduction,
            lengthening attention span, improving sleep, and enhancing self-awareness. Research shows that meditation
            may improve symptoms of stress-related conditions, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Post Traumatic
            Stress Disorder. I often integrate meditation and mindfulness practices into my work with therapy clients.
            Everyone can benefit from learning meditation skills and building a regular, consistent meditation practice.
