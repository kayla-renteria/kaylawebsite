        <h2>Supervision for LPCAs and LMHCAs</h2>
        <p>As a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) and a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor-Supervisor
            (LPCC-S), I am a board approved supervisor for associate level clinicians seeking licensure in the
            states of
            Kentucky and Indiana. The goal of supervision is to obtain the necessary skills for ethical and
            effective
            practice. Supervision includes, but is not limited to, promotion of counselor identity and development,
            providing specific feedback on demonstration of counseling skills and documentation, and weekly
            supervision
            sessions (provided face-to-face and virtually) to meet board-required supervision hours toward
            licensure. As a
            supervisor, I love working with new counseling professionals as they explore their identity as a
            therapist and
            apply the skills that they are learning with their clientele. I believe that the relationship that
            supervisees
            hold with their supervisor is a powerful one that will likely shape the rest of their careers. Iâ€™m
            honored to
            work with new clinicians in guiding them toward their path as a therapist. If you are interested in
            supervision
            services, please request a consultation appointment to discuss your goals and determine if Renteria
            Counseling
            Services will be the best fit to meet your supervision needs.

        <h2>Professional Consultation</h2>
        <p>Renteria Counseling and Wellness offers professional consultation for mental health professionals seeking
            clinical
            or business support. The field of mental health counseling thrives on professional consultation. Sharing
            of
            ideas and supporting one another is key to providing optimal care to our clients and having successful
            practices. The goal of professional consultation is to provide support and feedback to therapists
            seeking to
            improve and expand upon their work with specific clientele, or for mental health professionals seeking
            guidance
            on starting or growing their business or private practice. Consultation is not supervision, and focuses
            more on
            assisting other professionals gain knowledge and support that benefits their practice. My areas of
            specialty
            include trauma, EMDR, depression and anxiety, and adolescents in therapy.

        <h2>EMDR Consultation</h2>
        <p>I am an EMDR certified therapist and an EMDRIA approved consultant-in-training. As a
            consultant-in-training, I
            am able to provide consultation to therapists that are working toward completion of basic training, or
            seeking
            certification. As a consultant-in-training, I work with my own consultant as part of my training and in
            order to
            ensure quality of consultation. I am passionate about EMDR and the amazing work that can be done through
            the use
            of this treatment model.
