    <h2>About Kayla</h2>
    <p class="intro">Welcome to Renteria Counseling and Wellness. Choosing a therapist can often be
      difficult--ensuring
      a good fit is vital to your experience in therapy. I would love to make this process a little
      easier for you by sharing a bit about me and my experiences. </p>

    <p>I am a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor serving
      adolescents and adults in the Louisville community. I’ve lived in the Kentuckiana region my whole life,
      growing up in New Albany, Indiana. My passion for seeking a deeper understanding of the human mind began
      in my undergraduate studies, where I majored in Philosophy. During these studies, I developed a love for
      exploring the human condition and the complexity of our experiences.</p>

    <p>I continued my academic career in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program at Indiana State University
      in Terre Haute, Indiana. There, I studied under a highly qualified team of mental health experts. After
      graduating with my Masters of Science, I pursued licensure as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in Indiana
      and as a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor in Kentucky.</p>
      
    <p>In 2022, I became a registered yoga teacher, as I have developed a passion for helping trauma survivors reconnect
      with their bodies as part of their healing journey.</p>

    <p>My professional experiences have provided me the opportunity to work in residential treatment, substance
      abuse treatment, foster care, community mental health, and most recently, private practice. I am currently
      specializing in the treatment of trauma for both adolescents and adults. I have been trained in evidence
      based practices that have been shown to be highly effective for anxiety, depression, and trauma. You can
      learn more about those treatment models under the Counseling Services tab.</p>

    <p>My mission is to work collaboratively and compassionately with you to address the areas you want to
      change in your life. I approach the therapy process with your strengths in mind, building upon them
      to give you the skills needed to harness strength and growth. In my office, you’ll find a comfortable,
      non-judgemental place to explore your goals and challenges. There is great power in sharing your story
      with a trusted person. I believe in that power, and I feel honored to be a part of that with each one
      of my clients.</p>

    <p>When you’re ready, give me a call. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you!</p>
