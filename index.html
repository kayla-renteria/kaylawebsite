        <p>
            I provide counseling services in my office or via telehealth. Therapy services are individualized
            and tailored to each client's unique needs. I specialize in treating depression, anxiety, and trauma.
            I'd love to talk with you about how I can help you or your family. Feel free to explore my website,
            and if you're ready to make an appointment, you can do so by giving me a call or clicking here:
