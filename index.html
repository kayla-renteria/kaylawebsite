        <h2>About Renteria Counseling and Wellness</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Renteria Counseling and Wellness provides outpatient therapy to adults, children, and families
            dealing with a variety of concerns, including depression, anxiety, relationship difficulties,
            stress management, and overcoming the effects of trauma.
        </p>

        <p>
            I provide counseling services in my office or via telehealth. Therapy services are individualized
            and tailored to each client's unique needs. I specialize in treating depression, anxiety, and trauma. I also
            offer a range of wellness services that compliment traditional counseling services, including meditation and
            yoga workshops, classes, and private sessions.
            I'd love to talk with you about how I can help you or your family. Feel free to explore my website,
            and if you're ready to make an appointment, you can do so by giving me a call or clicking here:
