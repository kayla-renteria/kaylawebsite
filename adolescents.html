    <h2>Adolescents in Therapy</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      Adolescence is a difficult time of life for many teens. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 5 teens
      have a mental health concern that impacts their school, work, or family and peer relationships. Many factors
      impact adolescent mental health, including genetic factors, family relationships, peer relationships, social
      pressures, body image, and trauma. Therapy can be a safe place for teens to process their thoughts and
      feelings.
      Renteria Counseling and Wellness engages adolescents by providing them with a comfortable, non-judgemental
      atmosphere
      to explore their concerns, while leveraging family values and strengths.
