    <h2>Depression and Anxiety</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      Depression and Anxiety are two of the most common mental health problems that bring people to therapy. These
      concerns affect millions of people each year.
      Depression is more than just feeling down. We all have our bad days where we dip into low moods. But
      depression is pervasive, and can affect many different parts of our lives. Often, people with depression
      report feeling tired, irritable, persistently sad or apathetic, or having a feeling of general discontent
      with their life. This may impact their work, school, or personal relationships.
    </p>
    <p> Anxiety occurs when an individual finds themselves worrying excessively and persistently about everyday
      things, or things that others may view as only mildly distressing. People with anxiety often experience
      fatigue, body tension, an inability to control their thoughts and worries, nausea, irritability, and a
      feeling that something bad is going to happen.
      Many things contribute to depression and anxiety, including genetic factors, stressful life events, and
      trauma, among other things. Both depression and anxiety are very treatable mental health concerns.
